# Data-Analysis-Projects

The dataset is from the website [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/). It provides a database storing LEGO Items -Sets, Parts, and Minifigs. The files are automatically updated daily.

In this project, I solved same data analysis questions in both SQL and Python.
The data I used in this project can also be found in the data file.
